# Full-blockable garbage websites:
- Twitter (never understood the reason of its existence)
- Instagram (garbage photoshop filters and ugly insects)
- Pinterest (never used, hence never need)
- TikTok (garbage shorts)
- Snapchat (garbage phone app)
- Linkedin (too pretentious and useless for my daily usage)
- Telegram (afaik only used by inferior software engineers, e.g. XDA devs)
- Slack (Kind of good chat platform, but stuff are locked behind paywall)
- Whatsapp (too many spam-scammers and too much bloatware)
- IMDb (don't like watching movies/series at all)
- Netflix (garbage paywall and useless for me)
- Youtube Music (invidious or piped.video are superior and free)
- Pixiv (I'm not a GunSlinger)
- Reuters (fake news no thanks)
- DeepL (non-paid is just as privacy-disrespectful as Google)
- Yahoo (absolute garbage, say no more)


# Full-blockable game services:
- Steam (GOG and piracy are superior, maybe unblocking the forum for game guides)
- Ubisoft (Same reason as Steam)
- Origin (Same reason as Steam)
- EpicGames (Same reason as Steam)
- Blizzard (Absolute garbage games)


# Garbage that's somewhat useful:
- Facebook (Bullying imbeciles & proclaiming any social media acc with your real name on it are frauds)
- Reddit (r/uBlockOrigin is good)
- Youtube (for limitless video storage space)
- Google images (reverse image search from pictures)
- Quora (rarely needed when searching for random questions)
- Bilibili (inferior language, but less bloated than Youtube and has good cat videos)
